Algorithms
==========

qc2 features a built-in package of native algorithms, which can be invoked through
dedicated classes and integrated with and run by :class:`~qc2.data.data.qc2Data`.
This section gives a brief overview of their implementation.
Integration with :class:`~qc2.data.data.qc2Data` will be discussed later in section :ref:`qc2data_section`.
